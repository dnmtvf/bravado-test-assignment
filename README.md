## Expected steps

You are suggested to clone this repo and then implement HTML/JSX markup according to design above and a single page application based on React+Redux. Application should be running on a project root (`/`). The sample data to use inside application should be taken using AJAX call from the users endpoint (`/users`).

Please note, the default app state contains all profile cards. When user starts typing, the results should be filtered in realtime, highlighting the matching string.

## The task highlights

* General SPA application performance, including searching, scrolling and highlighting speed.
